# Panacloud API Smart Contracts

Panacloud.org will offer 10 million Panacloud Tokens (ERC 20) Tokens through a crowd sale at a specified price i.e. 1 DAI. The maximum API tokens that can be minted will be 1 Billion Panacloud Tokens. This Panacloud Token will give the right to the owner to participate in Panacloud Governance including which APIs project proposals to accept for funding. The Panacloud Token holder will also use these Panacloud Tokens participate in Panacloud DAO and to select the API Projects for funding.

The life cycle of the API will start when someone proposes an idea to build an API. The person who will create this API Project Proposal will receive a API Project Idea Proposal NFT in his wallet. This API Project Idea Proposal NFT will give him ownership of the idea and also 1% of Revenue sharing rights if the project is built and subscribed.

The API developers will review the API Project Idea Proposal and if interested will submit a bid for development to the Panacloud DAO. The Panacloud DAO members will review the development bids and select a approprite development bid. Each development bid will include the estimated time and the funding required to build the API project. The profile of the developer will also be submitted. Panacloud DAO will select the approprite bid. 

As soon as the Development Bid is selected and approved for development, an API DAO will be created. The first member of the API DAO will be the API Project Idea Proposal NFT holder, he/she will transfer the NFT to the API DAO in exchange for API DAO Tokens. Panacloud DAO will also be given API DAO Tokens.

The ownership of each API project will be represented by a API Ownership NFT (ERC 721). The developer of the API will be the owner of the API Ownership NFT (if the API is developed by a team how will we give joint API NFT ownership?) As soon as API developer creates a API project on the Panacloud Portal an API Ownership NFT will be created and transfered to the API Developer Wallet.
